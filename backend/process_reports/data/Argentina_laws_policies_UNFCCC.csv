,,Decree 140/2007: Presidential decree declaring rational and efficient energy use a national priority,"This decree has far-reaching and ambitious goals to reduce energy consumption and promote the use of renewable energy in the public sector (including public transport and lighting), private industry and private residencies.<br />
<br />
The decree's main purpose is to announce a National Program for Rational and Efficient Energía Use, to guarantee funding for the program in the federal budget, to name the Energía Secretary as the main authority for implementing the plan and to create a federal commission to oversee and monitor progress.<br />
<br />
This Policy stipulates that 8% of all electric energy consumption must come from renewable sources by 2016.<br />
<br />
The National Programme for Rational and Efficient Energía Use is divided into actions to be realised in the 1) short term and 2) medium and long terms.<br />
<br />
In the short term (30 days from implementation) the commission is to initiate a 'massive' public education campaign about energy efficiency, take necessary measures to manage the replacement of incandescent light bulbs with energy efficient bulbs in all private residences in the country, begin work to rate the energy efficiency of all electric appliances, improve the energy efficiency in all sectors of public administration and promote agreements with energy providers, national universities and business associations to improve energy efficiency in private sectors.<br />
<br />
In the medium to long term, the actions are further subdivided by sectors:<br />
- Industry: formulate a strategy to increase competitiveness by reducing energy costs; work to monitor and improve energy efficiency with those corporations that voluntarily participate in the programme; disseminate and replicate the program; facilitate energy efficiency technology within the private sector; offer financing to small and medium companies who voluntarily invest in energy saving technology<br />
- Commercial and Service Sectors: tailor an energy efficiency programme to the specific circumstances of office buildings, retail shops, hotels, restaurants, commercial banks etc.; develop efficiency standards for the consumption of energy (lighting, heating and air-conditioning, food storage)<br />
- Education: incorporate energy efficiency and renewable energy themes into pre-existing curricula at primary and secondary education levels; develop postgraduate programs focussing on energy efficiency at national universities<br />
- Cogeneration: develop a plan to promote and regulate the cogeneration of electricity and heat with new and existing energy providing companies<br />
- Energía efficiency standards and labelling: designate maximum and minimum standards of energy efficiency for electric appliances and machines produced or commercialised in the country; propose a timeline to ban the production, importation and commercialisation of incandescent light bulbs<br />
- Public lighting: implement system technologies to make public street lighting and traffic lights more energy efficient<br />
- Transport: improve the management and distribution of public transport in regards to energy consumption; with corresponding authorities develop minimum stan-dards of efficiency for new automobiles; initiate a monitoring and maintenance program for public vehicles, commercial transport vehicles and taxis and limou-sines; design a public education campaign about the impacts of the excessive driving of automobiles<br />
- Residences: initiate a system of energy certification for newly constructed residences in co-operation with construction-industry associations, architect associations and universities; introduce energy efficiency as an indicator of construction quality in the academic departments of engineering and architecture; indicate maximum energy consumption guides for new homes based on regional geographies; optimise solar energy in new construction projects; incentivise reduction of energy consumption in existing residences; develop a strategy to design 'massive systems' of water heating using solar technology<br />
- Climate Change-Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): evaluate the role of<br />
CDM, including international carbon markets, in supporting energy efficiency projects; develop a plan to take advantage of international sources of financing and technological co-operation; promote the CDM in public and private entities that could have a role in identifying new energy efficiency projects",https://app.climatepolicyradar.org/documents/decree-140-2007-presidential-decree-declaring-rational-and-efficient-energy-use-a-national-priority_970c,2007-12-21T00:00:00+00:00,ARG,Decree 140/2007: Presidential decree declaring rational and efficient energy use a national priority,https://app.climatepolicyradar.org/documents/decree-140-2007-presidential-decree-declaring-rational-and-efficient-energy-use-a-national-priority_0f4f,,Decree,n/a,Executive,,CCLW,Mitigation,,Buildings;Energía;Industry;Transport;Water,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Energía Supply;Energía Demand;Transport,,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Capacity building|Governance;Institutional mandates|Governance;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",Mitigation,,Buildings;Energía;Industry;Transport;Water,Institutions / Administrative Arrangements;Energía Supply;Energía Demand;Transport,,"Standards, obligations and norms|Regulation;Capacity building|Governance;Institutional mandates|Governance;Processes, plans and strategies|Governance",,

Argentina Framework Law ,,National Plan for Mitigation and Adaptation to Climate Change ,"<p>This plan lays out the measures and instruments to achieve national mitigation and adaptation targets set out in the country’s NDC and Law 27520 on Minimum Budgets for Adaptation and Mitigation to Global Climate Change. The primary mitigation target is for Argentina not to exceed 349 MtCO2e Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions until 2030 across all sectors. The primary adaptation target is to strengthen resilience and contribute to capacity building to reduce climate change vulnerability, accounting for gender equality. The Plan’s six strategic lines include energy transition, productive transition, sustainable mobility, sustainable and resilient territories, conservation of biodiversity and common goods, and sustainable management of food and systems.  &nbsp;</p>
